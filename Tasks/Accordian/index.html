        <span>Where are these chairs assembled?</span>
        <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i>
        <p>Our chairs are assembled in our manufacturing facility in Pune, 
            India. The wood components are sourced from sustainably managed 
            forests in Kerala, while the metal frames are produced in 
            Gujarat. Each chair undergoes a final quality inspection before 
            being packaged and shipped to customers.</p>
